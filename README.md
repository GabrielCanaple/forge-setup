# NOTE

This project works for me and my workflow. Although I tried to make it as flexible as possible, it still has been thought and conceived for my needs.

Also, it doesn't have the ambition of being great code. Although I tried to make it resilient and idempotent, I am not an expert at all in Bash nor in any of the programs used here. Use with caution.

# Usage

- `git clone git@github.com:GabrielCanaple/forge-setup.git ~/forge-setup && cd ~/forge-setup`

- `bash setup.sh`
